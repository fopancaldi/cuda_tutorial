Code I have used to display some basic functionalities of [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) while learning it.

# Getting started

## Prerequisites

The code should be run on a CUDA-capable machine, i.e. one where the CUDA toolkit was installed.

There are no dependencies. TODO: cufft

## Installation

Clone the repo.

# Usage

    cmake -S . -B build
    cmake --build build

TODO: `-DDISABLE_CUFFT`
Then `build` will contain TODO.
